# 🐍 Python Playground

> *"Learning by building — one project at a time."*

Welcome to my **Python Playground** — a collection of scripts, experiments, and small projects created during my learning journey in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**.  
Each file here represents a step forward — from basic syntax to logic, functions, and real-world mini applications.
